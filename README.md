# Advent of  Code 2023

This year I decided to do it in TypeScript to have some more exposure to the frontend & Node.js stack.

After cloning, run `npm install`

To run unit tests (consisting of all examples & my specific instances of problem inputs), run `npm run test`

To run a specific day challenge as standalone, run `npx ts-node src/<day>/<day>.ts`

Linter run is available via `npm run lint:js`, automatic attempt at formatting via `npm run format`

Explicit transpilation is done via `npm run build`
